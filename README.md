# module-2-hw
Module 2 Challenge features building a web application from scratch. This week, we'll be building a portfolio page which can be used as the course progresses. 
The portfolio will showcase projects built by students demonstrating their skills working on different projects with live web applications. 
This challenge will feature core skills students have learned: Flexbox, Media Queries, and CSS Variables. 
Placeholder images and names can be used to showcase if students do not have enough web applications. They can be changed later in the course. 
The User Story will be from the perspewctive of a hiring manager following the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.
The Acceptance Criteria goes as follows:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

A Mock Up sample is used to show the following animation that displays the web application's apperance and functionality.
