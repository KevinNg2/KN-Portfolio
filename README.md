Module 2 Challenge features building a web application from scratch. This week, I've built a portfolio page which can be used as the course progresses. 
The portfolio showcases projects I've built demonstrating my skills working on different projects with live web applications. 
This challenge will feature core skills I've learned: Flexbox, Media Queries, and CSS Variables. 
Placeholder images and names will be used since I do not have enough web applications. They will be changed later in the course. 

The User Story will be from the perspective of a hiring manager following the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.
The Acceptance Criteria goes as follows:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN my portfolio is loaded
THEN you will be presented with  my name, a photo of me, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
WHEN one of the links in the navigation is clicked,
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN the section about my work is clicked,
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of The Crossfit gym that I currently train at, a HTML Page I created about my favorite band, The Doors, and a Youtube link about a sport called Underwater Torpedo League.
My first application is going to be larger in size than the other applications.
WHEN the images of the applications are clicked,
THEN it will be a deployed application to the corresponding website. 
WHEN the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices,
THEN the screen will be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport

I have used the mock up sample to recreate my own personal portfolio following the animation that displays the web application's apperance and functionality.
